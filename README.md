## Update 0.2

I'm going to be working on 0.2 which is the Cipher update, which includes a coding language.

### Changelogs in this update:

| Update                  | Name    |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Coding Language (50%)   | Nectar  |
| Pen Graphics (24%)      | Origin  |
| MIDI (Made by RokCoder) |         |
| Data Fencing            | SYSHELP |

The commands --send and --find will be deleted as the coding language will have variable manipulation.

## Conclusion

Thanks for checking out Kernel Magic! Please report any issues if necessary.

Helping is greatly appreciated.
